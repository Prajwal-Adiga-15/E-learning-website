                </div>
                <p>Algebra is one of the broad areas of mathematics, together with 
                    number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, 
                    algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for 
                    manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost
                     all of mathematics.It includes everything from elementary 
                     equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, 
                     rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called 
                     elementary algebra; the more abstract parts are called abstract 
                     algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally 
                     considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, 
                     or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and 
                     economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, 
                     studied primarily by professional mathematicians.</p><br>
                <p>Algebra began with computations similar to those of arithmetic, with 
                    letters standing for numbers. This allowed proofs of properties that 
                    are true no matter which numbers are involved. For example, in the 
                    quadratic equation.<br><br> <h3>ax^{2}+bx+c=0</h3></p>
