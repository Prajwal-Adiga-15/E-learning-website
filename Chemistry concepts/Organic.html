                <p>Organic chemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies the 
                    structure, properties and reactions of organic compounds, 
                    which contain carbon in covalent bonding. Study of structure 
                    determines their chemical composition and formula. The study 
                    of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and 
                    preparation of carbon-containing compounds. Most organic 
                    compounds contain carbon and hydrogen, but they may also include 
                    any number of other elements (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, 
                    phosphorus, silicon, sulfur).</p><br>
                <p>Organic compounds form the basis of all earthly life and 
                    constitute the majority of known chemicals. The bonding 
                    patterns of carbon, with its valence of four formal single, 
                    double, and triple bonds, plus structures with delocalized 
                    electrons make the array of organic compounds structurally 
                    diverse, and their range of applications enormous. They form 
                    the basis of, or are constituents of, many commercial products 
                    including pharmaceuticals; petrochemicals and agrichemicals, 
                    and products made from them including lubricants, solvents; 
                    plastics; fuels and explosives. The study of organic chemistry 
                    overlaps organometallic chemistry and biochemistry, but also 
                    with medicinal chemistry, polymer chemistry, and materials science.
